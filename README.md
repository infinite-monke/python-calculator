# python-calculator
A calculator that (eventually) will be able to carry out every operation in Python's math, cmath, and random modules.

# Installing the Calculator
First clone the repo with this command:

git clone https://github.com/infinite-monke/python-calculator/calculator-main.git

Then change the directory to the calculator's:

cd calculator-main

Since everything used in this calculator was prebuilt into python, that's it!

# Using the calculator

Usage is simple; just run this command:

python3 -m calculator2

If you want to run the legacy version, use the same command but just "calculator" at the end.
